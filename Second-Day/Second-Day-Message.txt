On this second day, I focused learning on some of the words that I commonly see in most git encounters, especially that these words are essentially used in version control.

These are Local Repositories, Remote Repositories, git fetch, and git merge.

On this second day, I also jump into depth analysis in using git fetch.

----------------------------------

Local Repository: Serves as an empty repository that is stored in your computer, mainly used to add files, add commits and branches.

Remote Repository: Indicates the version of your repository placed in applications like github, it is used to keep track of your repository.

git fetch: mostly fetches metadata (a data about data) or information about the remote branches from your local repository and fetches commits, branches from remote repositories (basically the commits inside the remote branches)

git merge: mostly used to merge the current branch of the local repository and the given branch (git merge <branch_name>)


Command Line History:

*I encountered something like (END) and I do not know how to enter a command line, this was the second or third attempt of doing git, that is why in this command line, there are added files already. Thanks to stackoverflow I saw that I need to press "q + enter" for a new line.

-------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

- git fetch is a great way to understand what is happening on your local repository. It is a great way to keep track of the record of your local repository. 

-------------------------------------------

Apparently, some part of fetch confuses me, I just need to continue grinding and come up with an answer. :DD
