---------------------------------------------------------

Honestly, I got confuse on implementing branches. First of all I thought if making branche will have its own working and staging area, I really thought that the main or master branch has its own working and staging area. ChatGPT pointed me out that branches do not have working and staging area, they are globally spaces between the local repository and remote repository. Moreover, I got confuse when switching branches to another, whenever I switch to the master branch, the added file in the other branch will be updated and added in the working directory (or area) and it will also leave a message as well that the file is added. From those scenarios, I realized that branches are just for editing purposes, meaning it is a tool commonly for experimenting and provide features.

I may need to experiment more on branches XD
