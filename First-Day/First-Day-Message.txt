This was the first time I jump into deep analysis towards git. I got into conflicts (I don't know how I got those conflicts) when I failed to push the current branch. I don't know what to do so I asked chatgpt and advised me to use fetch and merge when encountering this kind of methods. 

Well I asked if what is the purpuse of git fetch and git merge:
(Based on my understandings)

git fetch is used to retrieve changes from a remote repository? (To be honest I don't know, I am confuse of this so-called remote repositories, branches and stuff)
git merge is used to merge the current branch (which is the commit I did today) and the last branch(the recently commited which I did yesterday), I mean atleast I can quite understand it.

To be honest there are tons of things that I need to learn towards git not just the commands but some of the words that are defined like origin, master, branches. For real, I do not not them ;-;
